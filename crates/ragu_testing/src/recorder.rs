//! The patcher engine: a recording driver plus a constraint-graph repair
//! solver (issues #728, #793, #796).
//!
//! [`Recorder`] is a [`Driver`] that captures the constraint graph ragu
//! actually emits during synthesis — every multiplication gate `a·b = c`,
//! every linear-combination wire, every `enforce_zero` — together with the
//! honest wire values, as a flat list of [`Event`]s over `usize` wires.
//!
//! [`repair`] then plays the malicious prover: given a witness whose free
//! advice wires have been mutated, it solves the captured constraints for
//! the remaining wires, propagating the cheat as far as the constraints
//! force it to go — and *no further*. A wire no constraint pins keeps its
//! honest value, and [`constraints_hold`] reports whether the result
//! satisfies every captured constraint. Comparing that verdict against an
//! independent native oracle is the patcher differential: ragu accepting a
//! witness the oracle rejects is an under-constrained-advice signal.
//!
//! The engine lives here rather than in the fuzz target so it is unit
//! tested ([`selftest`] runs in CI as a plain test) and reusable against
//! real circuits (issue #793).

///
/// * **Free wires are never overwritten.** Both passes only assign wires
///   outside `free`, so the prover's committed degrees of freedom (the
///   cheated advice, and in accomplice mode the fixed advice) are preserved
///   exactly — repair cannot "fix" a cheat by silently editing what the
///   prover committed.
/// * **Found ⇒ feasible.** Any assignment the linear solve emits satisfies
///   the linear subsystem by construction; the nonlinear gates it could not
///   include are re-checked by `constraints_hold`. An inconsistent subsystem
///   (no extension of the current knowns exists) is left unsolved, so the
///   residual violation surfaces rather than being papered over.
/// * **Under-determination is benign.** A genuinely free derived direction
///   (an under-constraint) leaves the linear system rank-deficient; repair
///   pins the free parameters to honest values and solves the rest. Picking
///   one satisfying witness is correct — a malicious prover could submit it
