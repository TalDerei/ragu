//! Circuit constraint analysis, metrics collection, and routine identity
//! fingerprinting.
//!
//! This module provides constraint system analysis by simulating circuit
//! execution without computing actual values, counting the number of
//! gates and constraints a circuit requires. It simultaneously
//! computes Schwartz–Zippel fingerprints for each routine invocation via the
//! merged [`Counter`] driver, which combines constraint counting with identity
//! evaluation in a single DFS traversal.
//!
//! # Fingerprinting
//!
//! Every routine invocation is recorded with two fingerprints, separating
//! polynomial equivalence (floor planning) from memoization safety
//! (cache keys):
//!
//! - [`BaseFingerprint`] — `(num_gates, num_constraints, eval)`. Captures
//!   the routine's local $s(X,Y)$ contribution: the gate/constraint shape of
//!   its base segment and the Schwartz–Zippel evaluation scalar obtained by
//!   running the routine on four independent geometric sequences (one per
//!   `a`/`b`/`c`/`d` wire) with constraint coefficients folded via Horner in
//!   `y`. Two routines with the same `BaseFingerprint` contribute the same
//!   thing to $s(X,Y)$ with overwhelming probability.
//!
//! - [`DeepFingerprint`] — `{ base, deep }`. Extends the base fingerprint
//!   with a recursive 64-bit BLAKE2b digest that binds the input/output
//!   [`TypeId`]s, the raw geometric-sequence evaluations of the routine's
//!   output-gadget wires, and the deep fingerprints of every direct child
//!   routine. Two invocations with the same `DeepFingerprint` are
//!   structurally identical at every nesting level and can be memoized
//!   together with their entire subtree.
//!
//! Fingerprints are wrapped in [`RoutineIdentity`], an enum that distinguishes
//! the root circuit body ([`Root`](RoutineIdentity::Root)) from actual routine
//! invocations ([`Routine`](RoutineIdentity::Routine)). `RoutineIdentity`
//! deliberately does **not** implement comparison or hashing traits, forcing
//! callers to handle the root variant explicitly rather than accidentally
//! including it in equivalence maps.
//!
