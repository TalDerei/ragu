//! Multi-stage circuit witness generation with staged wire allocation.
//!
//! The staging system separates witness generation into explicit **stage
//! polynomials** ($a(X)$, $b(X)$, ...) that can be committed independently,
//! and an implicit **final trace** ($r'(X)$) that consumes their outputs.
//! Together these form the full trace polynomial:
//!
//! $$
//! r(X) = r'(X) + a(X) + b(X) + \cdots
//! $$
//!
//!
//! Staged polynomials enable the prover to commit to portions of the witness
//! before computing the full circuit.
//!
//! ## Two-Phase Builder Pattern
//!
//! The [`StageBuilder`] uses a two-phase protocol:
//!
//! 1. **Wire reservation** — Call [`configure_stage`](StageBuilder::configure_stage)
//!    (or [`add_stage`](StageBuilder::add_stage) for stages implementing
//!    [`Default`]) for each stage polynomial. This reserves non-overlapping
//!    wire positions without computing values yet, ensuring all provers agree
//!    on wire layout.
//!
//! 2. **Witness generation** — Call [`finish`](StageBuilder::finish) to get the
//!    driver, then populate each stage via [`StageGuard::enforced`] or
//!    [`StageGuard::unenforced`]. The remaining code computes $r'(X)$.
//!
//! After phase 1, the trace polynomial has a fixed structure:
//!
//! $$
//! r(X) = \underbrace{a(X)}\_{\text{wires 0--99}} + \underbrace{b(X)}\_{\text{wires 100--101}} + \underbrace{r'(X)}\_{\text{wires 102+}}
//! $$
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! See the `compute_v` module in `ragu_pcd` crate for a real-world multi-stage
//! circuit, or the [staging chapter] in the book.
//!
//! See the parent module's [stage output contracts] section for what
//! [`Stage::witness`] does and does not guarantee about the wires inside the
//! gadget it returns, and how [`StageGuard::enforced`]/[`unenforced`] differ in
//! how they treat those wires.
