//! The "patcher" technique with a real repair engine (issues #728, #793).
//!
//! `fuzz_circuit_cheat` is a patcher whose "repair" is re-tracing the
//! circuit on the mutated witness: every wire — including advice — is
//! recomputed by the gadget's own witness logic. That can never expose an
//! under-constrained *advice* wire, because the gadget always recomputes
//! the *correct* advice on a re-run, masking a missing constraint.
//!
//! This target closes that gap. It synthesizes a [`ragu_testing::substrate`]
//! program through a **recording driver** that captures the constraint
//! graph ragu actually emits — every multiplication gate `a·b=c`, every
//! linear-combination wire, every `enforce_zero` — together with the honest
//! wire values. The patcher then mutates one or more *free advice* wires
//! and **repairs through the captured constraints**, not through the gadget
//! logic:
//!
//! * a multiplication gate forces `c := a·b`,
//! * a linear-combination wire is recomputed from its terms,
//! * a copy constraint (`enforce_equal`, the 2-term `enforce_zero` ragu
//!   emits to wire a fresh gate input to an operand) forces the later wire
//!   to equal the earlier one,
//! * every other `enforce_zero` is a *check*, not a repair rule.
//!
//! A fixpoint pass applies those rules until the values stabilise. The
//! result is the witness a malicious prover could submit: it satisfies
//! exactly the constraints ragu emitted, and *only* those.
//!
//! # Vocabulary
//!
//! The repair engine only models `{Lin, Gate, 2-term copy, ≤1-term check}`
//! constraint shapes, so the vocabulary is restricted to the substrate ops
//! that emit *only* those: `OpSet::ALL` minus the boolean ops (which emit
//! 3-term `a + b = 1` enforces and gates the repair engine does not model)
//! and the value-fallible ops (`Invert`/`Divide`/`AllocRaw`, whose
//! inverse-hint constraints are likewise out of model). The free advice the
//! patcher mutates is the element-stack advice (witness inputs,
//! `AllocSpecial`, and `AllocSquare` roots). This is a genuine widening
//! over the historical Add/Sub/Mul/Scale/AllocSquare/Anchor set —
//! `Square`, `Double`, `Negate`, `Fold`, and `AllocConst` now participate.
//!
//! # The differential
//!
//! Alongside the captured graph the substrate's native `Fp` shadow knows
//! each gadget's true semantics (the oracle), independent of ragu. For the
//! mutated witness:
//!
//! * `ragu_accepts` — do all captured constraints hold after repair?
//! * `native_satisfied` — does the native shadow, recomputing the full
//!   dependency chain, still satisfy every anchor?
//!
//! The assertion is `ragu_accepts == native_satisfied`. For a correctly
//! constrained circuit the captured-constraint repair and the native
//! recompute agree. **If a gadget omits a constraint, repair fails to
//! propagate the cheat** (there is no captured rule to carry it), so the
//! anchored wire keeps its honest value and ragu accepts, while the native
//! shadow — which knows the true relation — reports the anchor violated.
//! That disagreement is the under-constrained-advice signal.
//!
//! `PATCHER_SELFTEST=1` builds a deliberately under-constrained circuit
//! directly in the recorder (a root and a "square" allocated as independent
//! free wires, with the `square = root²` gate omitted) and confirms the
//! oracle fires — proof the soundness direction is not vacuous.
