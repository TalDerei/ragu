//! Witness-inspection coverage augmentation POC.
//!
//! Same substrate dispatch as `fuzz_element_ops` (shared via
//! [`ragu_testing::substrate`]), but with an added coverage-augmentation
//! step at the end of each successful simulation: the final witness state
//! (element values + boolean values) is hashed and the hash is "spread"
//! across branches that SanitizerCoverage's PC-guard instrumentation
//! tracks as edges. The intent is to bias libFuzzer toward exploring
//! distinct *internal witness states* even when the `Simulator`'s
//! Rust-level branches don't differ between inputs.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! libFuzzer's coverage feedback is edge-based: it tracks which branches
//! the target binary took. The `Simulator` is a Rust interpreter, so it
//! has plenty of native branches (one per `Op` arm, plus error paths
//! inside each gadget), and libFuzzer naturally explores them. But two
//! inputs can take the *same* Rust branches in the simulator and still
//! produce structurally different witnesses — different `is_zero` results,
//! different `ConditionalSelect` outcomes, different element values
//! flowing through downstream ops — that the fuzzer doesn't distinguish.
//!
//! This target augments coverage with a witness-state fingerprint: at the
//! end of each successful simulation, the final element- and boolean-
//! value vectors are hashed to a `u64`, and each set bit of that hash is
//! used to fire a distinct `if` branch under `black_box`. libFuzzer's
//! PC-guard instrumentation then sees those branches as separate edges,
//! and combinations of set bits become new coverage. The fuzzer biases
//! mutation toward inputs that produce previously-unseen witness states.
//!
//! # Comparison protocol
//!
//! Run `fuzz_element_ops` and `fuzz_witness_coverage` for the same wall-
//! clock budget on empty corpora. Compare libFuzzer's reported `cov`
//! (edges), `ft` (features), and especially **corpus size** (saved inputs
//! that triggered new coverage). The augmentation is valuable if the
//! corpus grows faster or the explored input space is more diverse.
//!
//! The augmentation costs ~28% throughput in measured runs (extra hashing
//! plus the 64-branch coverage spray per iteration). It is kept opt-in as
//! a separate target rather than applied to all targets so users can
//! choose the trade-off per campaign.
