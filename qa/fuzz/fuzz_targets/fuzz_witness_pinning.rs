//! Witness-pinning soundness oracle: mutate one coefficient of a
//! satisfying trace polynomial and demand the constraint identity reject.
//!
//! This is the constraint-side counterpart to `fuzz_witness_cheat`. That
//! target perturbs values *during* Simulator execution, where every
//! downstream gadget recomputes honestly from the perturbed input — gates
//! self-satisfy by construction, so the Simulator can never expose an
//! under-constrained gadget. The actual soundness question lives on the
//! wiring side: does the constraint system *pin* every witness value the
//! Rust witness generator assigns, or would a prover-chosen substitute
//! pass verification?
//!
//! In Ragu's algebraic formulation (see `fuzz_circuit_revdot_identity`),
//! "witness w satisfies the constraints" is the identity
//!
//! ```text
//! r.revdot(r + r.dilate(z) + s(X, y) + t(X, z)) == circuit.ky(instance, y)
//! ```
//!
//! holding at random `(y, z)`, where `r` is the assembled trace
//! polynomial. The oracle here:
//!
//! 1. Build a satisfying witness and its assembled `r` (alpha = 0).
//! 2. Sanity: the identity holds honestly at two independent `(y, z)`
//!    points (this subsumes `fuzz_circuit_revdot_identity`'s check).
//! 3. Pick one *occupied* coefficient of `r`, add a fuzzer-chosen nonzero
//!    delta, and rebuild the identity with the mutated `r'` — same
//!    instance, same `ky`, a genuinely different witness.
//! 4. Assert the identity now FAILS at one of the two points. If a
//!    changed witness coefficient still satisfies the constraint
//!    identity, nothing in the constraint system pins that wire: a
//!    malicious prover could substitute it freely. That is the
//!    assignment-vs-constraint gap — panic with the offending degree.
//!
//! # The circuit substrate must be fully pinned
//!
//! The step-4 assertion ("mutating any occupied coefficient breaks the
//! identity") is only valid when *every* live wire is constrained — a
//! genuinely free advice wire could take the mutated value and still
//! satisfy the identity, which is correct, not a bug. The original target
//! used two hand-written circuits (`SquareCircuit`, `MySimpleCircuit`) that
//! happen to be fully determined. To run the same oracle over arbitrary
//! generated [`ragu_testing::substrate`] programs, we *force* full pinning:
//! after the fuzzer-chosen op body, an `Anchor` is appended for every
//! element slot, pinning each wire to its honest value. Every live trace
//! coefficient is then determined (element wires directly; gate input wires
//! transitively via the mul gates' copy constraints), so any single-
//! coefficient perturbation must be rejected.
//!
//! # Why this has (essentially) no false positives
//!
//! For a pinned coefficient, the mutated identity defect Δ(y, z) is a
//! nonzero polynomial of degree ≤ 8n in y and z, so it vanishes at a
//! random point with probability ~deg/|F| ≈ 2^-245. The fuzzer chooses
//! `y, z` from u64 seeds, so the only *reachable* structured roots are
//! tiny values; we bail on y, z ∈ {0, 1} and additionally require the
//! defect to vanish at a second, affinely independent point before
//! declaring a bug.
//!
//! Mutation is restricted to coefficients that are live for the chosen
//! circuit. The live-degree mask is computed from probe traces of the same
//! circuit under several witnesses, then unioned with the current trace's
//! nonzero coefficients. This avoids mutating structural padding and
//! intentionally-dead allocation slots while still allowing zero-valued
//! live wires in the current trace to be mutated.
