//! Mid-stream witness cheating fuzz target.
//!
//! Runs the same instruction stream twice through the `Simulator`: an
//! honest path and a cheat path that, at a fuzzer-chosen point, replaces
//! one element on the stack with a fresh allocation whose value differs
//! from the honest one. After both runs complete, the final element and
//! boolean values are compared.
//!
//! The op grammar, byte decoding, and gadget dispatch live in
//! [`ragu_testing::substrate`]; the cheat is injected through the
//! substrate's pre-op synthesis hook. This harness owns the cheat
//! machinery, the dead-cheat triage, and the fingerprint comparison.
//!
//! # Current effective behavior
//!
//! As implemented, this target functions primarily as a Simulator
//! robustness fuzzer rather than a soundness oracle. The cheated slot is
//! included in the comparison fingerprint, and the cheat value is filtered
//! to differ from the original, so `honest != cheat` is tautologically
//! true regardless of whether downstream constraints actually catch the
//! cheat. The signals the target reliably surfaces today are panics, OOB
//! indexing, and arithmetic faults in the gadget API when fed adversarial
//! inputs — not under-constrained gadgets.
//!
//! # The constraint-side oracles live elsewhere
//!
//! The originally planned "patcher" pass cannot turn this target into an
//! under-constrained-gadget oracle: every downstream gadget recomputes
//! honestly from the cheated value, so gates self-satisfy by construction
//! and the constraint matrix is never consulted — Simulator-side
//! perturbation, with or without a patcher, observes only witness
//! generation. The true oracles are `fuzz_witness_pinning` (single-wire
//! trace-coefficient mutation against the revdot identity),
//! `fuzz_circuit_cheat` (input mutation against the assembled constraint
//! identity), and `fuzz_advice_patcher` (advice mutation repaired through
//! the captured constraint graph). This target remains in the rotation for
//! what it demonstrably catches: panics, OOB indexing, and arithmetic
//! faults in the gadget API under adversarial mid-stream value
//! substitution.
