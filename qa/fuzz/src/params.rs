//! Fuzzer-chosen field and rank, so a target is not pinned to a single
//! monomorphization for its whole life.
//!
//! Most of the generic pipeline was written against `Fp` and [`TestRank`],
//! and for a good reason: that is the cheap pair. `TestRank` is `R<7>`, so
//! `n = 32` gates and 128 coefficients; [`ProductionRank`] is `R<13>`, so
//! `n = 2048` and 8192 coefficients — sixty-four times the vector length,
//! and the polynomial work scales with it. A target that ran every input at
//! production rank would lose most of its executions per second, and
//! execution count is what finds bugs.
//!
//! The cost of that choice was that the rank actually shipped to users, and
//! the second field of the cycle, were exercised only where a target
//! happened to name them outright. Rank-specific arithmetic — anything
//! sensitive to `n`, to `log2_n`, or to a coefficient count that is no
//! longer a small number — was reachable in principle and unreached in
//! practice.
//!
//! This module restores both without handing the throughput back. The
//! fuzzer picks, but the distribution is deliberately lopsided: rank comes
//! out of a nominal one-in-sixteen draw, so most inputs stay at test rank
//! and a minority pay for production coverage. Fields are drawn evenly,
//! because `Fp` and `Fq` cost the same.
//!
//! "Nominal" is doing real work in that sentence. The ratio is exact for a
//! uniformly random byte and only approximate under a live fuzzer, whose
//! byte distribution is whatever coverage feedback drives it to. See
//! [`PRODUCTION_BAND`] for how the first version of this got it backwards,
//! and measure with a target's own stats hook rather than assuming.
//!
//! # Why a macro and not a type parameter
//!
//! [`Rank`](ragu_circuits::polynomials::Rank) is a sealed trait over a
//! const-generic `R<RANK>`, and the field is likewise a compile-time type.
//! Neither can be chosen at run time by value, so the choice has to be a
//! `match` that monomorphizes its body once per arm. [`with_rank!`] and
//! [`with_field!`] are that match, written once. The cost is that each
//! target's body is compiled twice per axis; the benefit is that a target
//! opts in by wrapping its body rather than by being rewritten.
