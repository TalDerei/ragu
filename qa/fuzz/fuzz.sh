#   ./fuzz.sh triage <file>                   # Triage a fuzz_witness_cheat crash
#   ./fuzz.sh cmin [target]                   # Minimize corpora in place (all targets if omitted)
#   ./fuzz.sh regress [target]                # Replay committed crash reproducers once each
#   ./fuzz.sh coverage [target]               # Corpus coverage report (union report if all targets)
#   ./fuzz.sh seeds [target] [seconds]        # Generate a local seed set from a short run
#   ./fuzz.sh census                          # Check the four target lists agree
#
# Seeds: seeds/<target>/ is gitignored, local-only, and read-only to a run.
# Nothing is committed. This substrate's decoder is total — every byte slice
# is a valid program — so libFuzzer bootstraps any target from an empty
# corpus, and CI relies on the cron's durable corpus artifact rather than on
# seeds. They exist only to warm up a laptop run: `./fuzz.sh seeds` fuzzes
# into a scratch corpus, minimizes it, and copies the smallest survivors
# across.
# `./fuzz.sh census` is what CI runs to check every target is listed in
# fuzz.sh, and in both workflow matrices.
#
# Crash-regression inputs: when a fuzz run finds a real bug, commit the
# minimized reproducer to regressions/<target>/ (tracked in git, unlike
# corpus/ and seeds/). `./fuzz.sh regress` replays every committed
# reproducer once and fails on any crash; the cron does the same before
# each fuzz run.
#
# The DICT=1 path passes -dict=dict.txt to libFuzzer. Empirical comparison
# (60s on fuzz_element_ops): roughly flat coverage with a small features
# decrease; on fuzz_poseidon_sponge: small features and corpus increase.
# Worth trying for Poseidon-heavy targets in longer runs.
#
# By default this script passes `-s none` to cargo-fuzz, skipping
# AddressSanitizer for a large throughput win on simulator-heavy targets
# — measured ~70% on fuzz_witness_cheat (50k → 84k exec/s), ~30% on
# fuzz_poseidon_sponge, ~10% on fuzz_element_ops. ASAN catches memory
# bugs (UAF, OOB on unwise unsafe, leaks across `Simulator::simulate`
# closures); to opt back in, set ASAN=1. The scheduled cron in
# `.github/workflows/fuzz-cron.yml` invokes `cargo "$NIGHTLY" fuzz run`
# directly and keeps ASAN regardless of this script's default. Crash
# artifacts found here should be reproduced under ASAN=1 before triaging
# to get proper allocation history.
#
# The `summarize` subcommand runs the target binary on a single corpus or
# crash file with the DEBUG_INPUT env var set, which each fuzz target
# respects: instead of running the fuzz body, the target parses the input
# via Arbitrary, prints it via Debug, and exits. Useful for triaging
# crash artifacts without manually decoding bytes.
#
# The `triage` subcommand runs fuzz_witness_cheat with TRIAGE_CHEAT=1,
# which walks the op stream tracking the cheated slot and reports how
# many downstream ops actually read it. A 0 count means the signal is a
# "dead cheat" false positive.
#
# Regenerate dict.txt via:
#   cargo "$NIGHTLY" run --release --bin extract_dict > dict.txt
