# Census of the fuzz target list, and of the seeds every target needs.
#
# The target list is written down in four places — `Cargo.toml`'s `[[bin]]`
# sections, `fuzz.sh`'s `TARGETS`, and the matrices of `fuzz-cron.yml` and
# `fuzz-coverage.yml` — and nothing kept them in step. A target added to
# `Cargo.toml` and forgotten in the cron is simply never fuzzed, silently and
# for as long as nobody counts.
#
# Committed seeds get the same treatment. `seeds/<target>` is what the cron
# merges into a cold corpus and what the coverage workflow replays when no
# corpus cache survives; a target with none makes coverage report
# "No corpus or seed inputs found" and exit green, which reads exactly like a
# clean run. So an empty seed directory fails here, on the pull request that
# introduced it, rather than passing quietly in a weekly report.
#
# Usage:
#   ./check_targets.sh          # census; non-zero exit on any mismatch
